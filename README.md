# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator Lite*

**Tip Calculator Lite** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Alicia Isler**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while building the app included completing the build and successfully running it only for the app to not allow me to input value amounts to calculate. The keyboard would randomly pop up or not pop up.
